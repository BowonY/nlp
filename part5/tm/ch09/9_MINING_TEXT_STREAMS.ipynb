    "The large amount of text data which are continuously produced over time in a variety of large scale applications such as social networks re- sults in massive streams of data. Typically massive text streams are created by very large scale interactions of individuals, or by structured creations of particular kinds of content by dedicated organizations. An example in the latter category would be the massive text streams cre- ated by news-wire services. Such text streams provide unprecedented challenges to data mining algorithms from an efficiency perspective. In this chapter, we review text stream mining algorithms for a wide variety of problems in data mining such as clustering, classification and topic modeling. We also discuss a number of future challenges in this area of research.\n"

This includes popular methods for topic detection and tracking in text stream. This is because the process of event detection is closely related to the clustering problem. The methods for classification of text streams are reviewed in section 3. Section 4 presents methods for evolution analysis of text stream. The conclusions and summary are presented in section 5."
